# Baguetter
- [简体中文](README_CN.md)


Baguetter is a flexible, efficient, and hackable search engine library implemented in Python. It's designed for quickly benchmarking, implementing, and testing new search methods. Baguetter supports sparse (traditional), dense (semantic), and hybrid retrieval methods.

**Note:** Baguetter is not built for production use-cases or scale. For such use-cases, please check out other search engine projects.

## Features

- Sparse retrieval using BM25 and BMX algorithms
- Dense retrieval using embeddings
- Hybrid retrieval combining sparse and dense methods
- Customizable text preprocessing pipeline
- Multi-threaded indexing and searching
- Evaluation tools for benchmarking
- Easy integration with HuggingFace datasets and models for sharing
- Hackable interface to quickly implement new methods

## Installation

```bash
pip install baguetter
```

## Quick Start

```python
from baguetter.indices import BMXSparseIndex

# Create an index
idx = BMXSparseIndex()

# Add documents
docs = [
  "We all love baguette and cheese",
  "Baguette is a great bread",
  "Cheese is a great source of protein",
  "Baguette is a great source of carbs",
]
doc_ids = ["1", "2", "3", "4"]

idx.add_many(doc_ids, docs, show_progress=True)

# Search
results = idx.search("quick fox")
print(results)

# Search many
results = idx.search_many(["quick fox", "baguette is great"])
print(results)
```

## Evaluation

Baguetter includes tools for evaluating search performance on standard benchmarks:

```python
from baguetter.evaluation import datasets, evaluate_retrievers
from baguetter.indices import BM25SparseIndex, BMXSparseIndex

results = evaluate_retrievers(datasets.mteb_datasets_small, {"bm25": BM25SparseIndex, "bmx": BMXSparseIndex})
results.save("eval_results")
```
